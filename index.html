    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <h2 class="maker1">My name is Sharon Smith and I am a Designer and Maker of Things, Physical and Digital</h2>
    <h3 class="maker2">(Hence the hammer)</h3>
    <h3>Get to know me!</h3>
    <p>As a metalsmith, I spend my time in my studio pounding on metal, forming and shaping it into a variety of objects from production jewelry to one-of-a-kind statement pieces to functional hollowware to small-scale sculpture and what I think of as "Curiosities". Feel free to browse through my various galleries to see what I've been up to at <a href="http://www.sharonsmithmetals.com/portfolios/metalsmithing/">SharonSmithMetals.com</a>. All the jewelry & metalwork on the site was designed and fabricated by me.</p>

    <p>Along with ranting about politics, I am very into original, indie, alternative, and punk bands and nearly always have music playing while I work. I love discovering new bands and could happily spend every night at a club. Current local Portland favorites are NTNT, Murderbait, and DeadCult- a group I first heard through the walls of my studio when they were playing the Lovecraft Bar, which happens to be next door.</p>

    <p>I'm an avid reader and will read just about anything I can get my hands on. In fact, I told my family that the main reason I chose to move to Portland was so I could hang out in Powell's. I wasn't entirely joking. Mostly, I read a lot of general fiction, classic fiction, urban fantasy/magical realism/mythic fiction (think Neil Gaiman, Charles De Lint, or the Dresden Files as opposed to epic/high fantasy like the Wheel of Time or Shannara books. Although I do love G.R.R. Martin), speculative fiction, horror, nonfiction about folklore & mythology, social commentary, graphic design, art, web design, and history. Like I said, avid reader.</p>
