      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp; Am I sarcastic?</h2>
      <div id="writeSarcasm"></div>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>YES</b></p>
      <p>It's my first language. I'm a punk rock chick from the Rust Belt. We're not allowed to speak without a certain level of sarcasm. Seriously. There's a law or something.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Do I like large black birds like crows & ravens?</h2>
      <div id="writeBirds"></div>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>YES</b></p>
      <p>I regard them as something of a spirit animal, so to speak. They represent the presence of my primary deity, the Morrigan, the Irish Goddess of War. Well, one of the Irish Goddesses of War. There's a bunch of them, which I suppose befits a people notorious for having hot tempers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Do I also love wombats?</h2>
      <div id="writeWombats"></div>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>YES</b></p>
      <p>I even have 2 stuffed wombats I consider my "pets". Their names are Watson & Wanda & they're adorable and cuddly. And it really is all North Dakota's fault. Spending that much time in a vast frozen flatness with no trees will seriously mess with your brain.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Was I a college radio DJ?</h2>
      <div id="writeRadio"></div>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>YES</b></p>
      <p>Yep! On WERG, that station for Gannon University. My air name was Molly McQuire. I took the name from a band of Irish miners rights activist/terrorists (depending on who you ask) that were tried & hung in my Dad's hometown of Pottsville, PA. I had a lot of regular listeners, too, who'd call in every time I was on the air.  Fun fact- WERG was the station for a different university than the one I was actually attending. In fact, we were cross-town rivals.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Do I hate to read?</h2>
      <div id="writeRead"></div>
      <p>The correct answer is <b>NO</b></p>
      <p>You've obviously never been to my apartment! I read constantly. I told my family that the reason I moved to Portland because of Powell's. I'm only half-kidding. It's a point of pride for me that my entire living room is lined with bookshelves & those shelves are full. I've got a number of shelves of books in my studio, too. I even picked up an e-reader because I ran out of room in my apartment for more shelves. I'm not allowed to work in bookstores any more because I have a tendency to spend my entire paycheck there. I have a similar problem with record stores.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  How many semesters did I teach Jewelry/Metalsmithing at UND?</h2>
      <div id="writeTeach"></div>
      <p>I taught for <b>6 semesters</b> & really loved it. One of my dream jobs would be a tenure-track Metals professor position at a university. It's probably the only job I'd leave Portland for. Well, other than Weta Workshop calling. I'd go make cool props for movies in a mad second.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#10022; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Can you name a city I've lived in?</h2>
      <div id="writeCity"></div>

      <p>Your answer was <b>-insert code here-</b></p>
      <p>So far, I've lived in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Erie, PA</li>
        <li>Baltimore, MD</li>
        <li>Union City, PA</li>
        <li>Grand Forks, ND</li>
        <li>Salem, OR</li>
        <li>Portland, OR</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm currently in Portland & I love it!'</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <h2>So, how did you do?</h2>
    <div id="codeID"></div>
    <p>You got <b>-insert code here-</b> for # correct.</p>
